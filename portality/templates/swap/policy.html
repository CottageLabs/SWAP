        <h3>Statement on Data &amp; Information Sharing</h3>
        
        <p>As a charity which supports adult learners in the development of their learner journey, the Scottish
        Wider Access Programme (SWAP) gathers and retains data relating to Programme participants. This
        data is used to monitor the effectiveness of the Programme, as well as to improve the student
        experience and to contribute to wider research relating to widening access in Scotland. SWAP tracks
        SWAP students throughout their studies both at college and, if applicable, at university. This data is
        used to compile reports which may be shared with relevant interested parties such as SWAP partner
        institutions, SWAP management groups, the Scottish Funding Council, and Scottish Government
        bodies.</p>
        
        <p><b>Any statistical or other reports SWAP subsequently publishes will never identify you as an
        individual.</b></p>
        
        <p>In addition to the personal information requested via the SWAP Online Registration Form, SWAP may
        gather and use data relating to you as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>SWAP requests data from colleges and universities relating to the programme, entry,
        progression, retention, attainment, and destination of individual current and former SWAP
        students;</li>
        <li>This data and the data obtained via the SWAP student registration form will be used for
        research and monitoring purposes, including for the publication of statistical reports. The
        dissemination of any such reports is limited to relevant partner organisations i.e. colleges,
        universities, funding and government bodies, and related educational institutions. SWAP will
        never publish any data which could lead to the identification of individuals.</li>
        <li>SWAP may enter into dialogue and share data from your SWAP registration form and / or
        your UCAS application form with any universities or colleges to which you apply. This will be
        in order to clarify issues relating to your status as a SWAP student and / or to resolve issues
        relating to university offers you have received or may receive.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Privacy Notice</b></p>
        
        <p>When registering with us - by signed form (if before 2013) or on-line and ticking the Terms and
        Conditions box, you agreed to allow us to store your personal data and to track your progress through
        college and, if applicable, through your subsequent journey in higher education. We will store your
        personal details and, if applicable, your UCAS offer detail, your access programme results and your
        onward destination. During your access year, SWAP will send regular updates to your college tutors
        on your UCAS application. Your college will give us data pertaining to any interim profile grades, if
        required by the universities to whom you have applied. The college will also give us information on
        your results at the end of your access programme. SWAP will also give your results data to the
        universities with whom you have a UCAS firm and insurance condition of offer.</p>
        
        <p>SWAP uses your data to evidence widening access, monitor your progress, provide you with support,
        monitor equal opportunities and gather feedback. SWAP uses all of your data in order to evidence the
        effectiveness of SWAP access programmes as a route for adult returners from widening access
        backgrounds into higher education. We require this data to report to our funders, the Scottish Funding
        Council, our partner institutions (the list of partner institutions is listed on our website
        <a href="http://www.scottishwideraccess.org" target="_blank">http://www.scottishwideraccess.org</a>) 
        and to Scottish government. There is no individual's personal
        data included in any reports published by SWAP. We only report using anonymous data. The legal
        basis for storing this data is that by ticking the box, and agreeing to the terms and conditions of
        becoming a SWAP student, you have entered into a contract with SWAP.</p>

        <p>Your personal data will be kept by SWAP for 8 years after completion of your access programme.
        After that, only information required to identify your access programme results and onward destination
        will be kept. This information is kept for 80 years, for archival purposes. All SWAP data is stored
        within the University of Edinburgh's secure IT systems.</p>
        
        <p>SWAP is a registered Data Controller and is fully compliant with the Principles and the other
        conditions set down in the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
