            <p style="font-size:14px;">NOTE that schools / universities users are also created and can be updated from the related schools 
            / universities supporting data.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">Schools / universities users should have a username that matches their email address, and must be associated with a school or university. NOTE THESE USERS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN VIEW_ADMIN OR DO_ADMIN PRIVILEGES.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">For LEAPS admin users, create a user with your preferred username, and select if the user should have DO_ADMIN or 
            VIEW_ADMIN privileges. Although you can tick both, a user with DO_ADMIN privileges also automatically has the ability to 
            view admin features anyway.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">VIEW_ADMIN allows a user to access the LEAPS /admin area and to view any information there, but NOT to edit anything. DO_ADMIN allows a user to access the LEAPS /admin area and to edit / delete / add to anything there.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">Some functions, such as creating new users (beyond those that can be created via the schools / universities supporting data), or turning surveys and schools / universities pages on and off, are only available to the super user. Super user privileges cannot be bestowed upon any new users via this interface - super users can only be created via the application settings on the server.</p>
