Reporting

showing trends across the years would be useful so graphs of the years and how they changed, such as male-female split over years, would be good.
Destinations across the years - a bar chart that shows destination stacks over each year.
Think of first in family going to HE, how does that change over the years.
Choices of virtually everything on the export chart is just about what they would need to show everything, and it would be great to show that over years.
Imaging showing marked differences in ethnicity.
Start with one chart, above the map. Select what it should show from a dropdown. Then also be able to create another chart.
Could the map show people moving about across the years at the same time too, so it can be seen how many people in a different year go to / from where.
Then so they can make a pdf printout.
