Progressions pathway to medicine not showing up

Exporting progressions - see Jodi Achampon in oldest archive - one works, but export all fails

For selection dropdowns should be quintile not decile

For the charts, we want to see post codes, ethnicities, gender, disability, first_in_family

For comparison charts - show each year total, split by some value choice
So can get ataglance difference, such as male/female split every year, or disability split every year

Change progressions 3rd and 4th year values to match 1st and 2nd year ones - just now only one field for 3rd and 4th year values

Default to showing last year and this year as chart figures

Reporting

showing trends across the years would be useful so graphs of the years and how they changed, such as male-female split over years, would be good.
Destinations across the years - a bar chart that shows destination stacks over each year.
Think of first in family going to HE, how does that change over the years.
Choices of virtually everything on the export chart is just about what they would need to show everything, and it would be great to show that over years.
Imaging showing marked differences in ethnicity.
Start with one chart, above the map. Select what it should show from a dropdown. Then also be able to create another chart.
Could the map show people moving about across the years at the same time too, so it can be seen how many people in a different year go to / from where.
Then so they can make a pdf printout.

Mark to filter UF export so that there are separate cells for university course and university - DONE, inst_shortname, coursecode, then other info fields added 
  Don't show conditions if filtering by UF
  Make sure there is a spacing between condition and offer, appears to not have a space at the moment
  break out the subject into its own cell as well
